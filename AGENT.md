# Things we should always do

- WARNING - DO NOT DO THIS ONE STEP UNTIL WE RESOLVE VERSION NUMBER QUESTIONS AND YOU ASK FOR PERMISSION!  In the fiture we will do the following but not now: Always update CHANGELOG.md after every change. Do not remove any lines from previous version headings in CHANGELOG.md
- Always scan over TODO.md and update it as appropriate
- Always updates docs/\* files as appropriate so they stay current and up to date. It's okay to have "future planning", and be sure those lines or sections or files are marked as such
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- All API responses must include error handling
- Follow REST naming conventions for endpoints (except use "\_" underscore rather than "-" dash in multi-word names)
