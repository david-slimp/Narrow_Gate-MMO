# Things we should always do

- Always update CHANGELOG.md after every change. Do not remove any lines from previous version headings in CHANGELOG.md
- Always scan over TODO.md and update it as appropriate
- Always updates docs/* files as appropriate so they stay current and up to date. It's okay to have "future planning", and be sure those lines or sections or files are marked as such
- Follow `drafts/Code_Steps.md` for workflow; include issue number in new branch names.
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- All API responses must include error handling
- Follow REST naming conventions for endpoints (except use "\_" underscore rather than "-" dash in multi-word names)
